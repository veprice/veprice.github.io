# Welcome to my Github!

Hello! I'm Virginia! Welcome to my github landing page!

## About Me

I am a creative nerd that is passionate about investigating the data of large, complex systems, and building tools to make those data accessible for others. I have 6+ years of experience with Python building visualization tools and analyzing qualitative and quantitative data as well as experience in MATLAB, R, and HTML/CSS.

I'm currently seeking employment as a data analyst or python developer! Feel free to contact me via email at [virginia.e.price@gmail.com](mailto:virginia.e.price@gmail.com); you can also [view my resume here](Resources/Resume_Data.pdf).

## Highlights

### Physics Simulations

Programs I completed and expanded upon as a teaching assistant for an introductory physics course that incorporated Python programming into its curriculum.
